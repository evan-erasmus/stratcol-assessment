 - Currencies are seeded upon installation.
 - Orders can be created, and are tracked using statuses.
 - Transactions are created when orders are created, or funds are deposited.
 - Error handling and validation included.
 - The app fulfills all the requirements outlined in the technical assessment, except for the bonus tasks.
 - Due to Laravel & Livewire being headful, as well as time constraints I have not created a separate REST API.
